> Write an __Inorder__ iterator for a binary tree with next() and hasNext() function. 

- Analysis:

  An inorder iterator is similar to inorder traversal of a binary tree. However, for the iterator, we just have to keep a state for the current node. 

Java implementation is showed as following:

```
public class TreeNode {
  int val;
  TreeNode left;
  TreeNode right;
  public TreeNode (int val) {
    this.val = val;
    left = null;
    right = null;
  }
}
public class Iterator {
  public 
}
```
