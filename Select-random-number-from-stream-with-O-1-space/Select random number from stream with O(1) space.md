## Slect a random number from stream with O(1) space. 

*Given a stream of numbers, generate a random number from the stream, you are allowed to use only O(1) space, 
and the input is in the form of stream, so can't store the previously seen numbers. <br>
So how do we generate a random number from the whole stream such that the probability of picking any number is 1/n with O(1) extra space?*
