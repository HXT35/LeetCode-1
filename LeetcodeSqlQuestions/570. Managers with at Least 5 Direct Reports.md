First get the `ManagerId` that appears for more than 5 times in the `Employee` table. 

Then JOIN the table with the generated `ManagerId` column based on Employee `Id` equals to `ManagerId`.  

```MySQL
SELECT
    Name
FROM
    Employee as t1 JOIN
    (SELECT
        ManagerId
     FROM
        Employee
     GROUP BY ManagerId
     HAVING Count(ManagerId) >= 5) as t2
     ON t1.Id = t2.ManagerId
;
```
