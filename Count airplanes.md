> Given the take off and landing time of airplanes, described using a list of intervals. How many airplanes are there in the sky simultaneously?
> Note that if multiple planes take off and land at the same time, landing has priority. 
> E.g. for a list of intervals like '[[1, 10], [2, 3], [5, 8], [4, 7]]', return '3'
