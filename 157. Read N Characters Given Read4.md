> This question is kind of obscure. Once the question is given in an interview, there is several questions we must ask before solve it. 
>   1. What is the destination buffer for the reading? In this case for leetcode, it turns out buf in the `read()` input is the destination we need to put data in.
>   2. What is the input buffer of `read4()` used for? In this case, it is the temporary buffer we put data being read in. 
>   3. What does this question means? Do we need to read exactly n characters or we need to read less than n characters. If we need to read 
>     exactly n characters, we need some extra code in the solution. 
>   4. What if there is less than n characters to read? In this case, we return all of them. 
> Finally, the solution looks like following:

- Algorithm: 
  1. Use a int total to record the number of characters already being read. 
  2. Use a boolean endFlag to indicates the end of the file being read by read4() function. And the end of the file is indicated by `read4()` returns
    number less than 4. 
  3. During the reading process, we put all we read into the destination buffer until we reaches a size of n. 
  
An implementation using Java is showed as following. Assume the time complexity of `read4()` is `O(1)`. Then the time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`.

```
/* The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
      int read4(char[] buf); */

public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Maximum number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of characters read
     */
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int total = 0;
        boolean endFlag = false;
        while(total < n && !endFlag) {
            char[] tmp = new char[4];
            int count = read4(tmp);
            if(count < 4) {
                endFlag = true;
            }
            count = Math.min(count, n - total);
            for(int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                buf[total++] = tmp[i];
            }
        }
        
        return total;
    }
}
```
