# Solution1: Heap

It is obvious that in order to solve this question, we need to at least scan the whole array once to get the frequency of each number. 
We could either store this feqeuency-number relationship pari into a wrapper class or into a array of length 2. 
I would use length-2 array because it is more efficient than a wrapper class. 
Then we could use several different approach to solve this question based on the frequency information we get. 
The most easy idea would be sorting the array based on frequency with algorithms like bubble sort, which would use `O(k * n)` time, or specifically, `O(n^2)` time in the worst case. We could also sort the array using quick sort, which would use `O(nlogn)` time. 
Moreover, we could further optimize the time complexity into `O(nlogk)` time, `O(n)` space with a minheap of size `k`. We scan the whole frequency-number array once and only store the `k` number with the largest feqeuency and throw out everything else during comparision. 
In addition, Quick search would also reduce the time complexity into amortized `O(n)` time. 
Bucket sort could also be used to solve this quesiton with `O(n)` time. 

```Java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * First let's consider the heap method since the O(nlogn) algorithm is pretty trival and easy to implement. 
     */
    public List<Integer> topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (!map.containsKey(num)) {
                map.put(num, 1);
            } else {
                map.put(num, map.get(num) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        Queue<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(k, new Comparator<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> e1, Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> e2) {
                return e2.getValue() - e1.getValue();
            }
        });
        
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            maxHeap.add(entry);
        }
        
        List<Integer> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            ret.add(maxHeap.poll().getKey());
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Bucket sort

```Java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * Bucket sort
     * Using idea similar to a bucket sort. 
     * In a bucket sort we need to know the range of the numbers we are sorting. 
     * However, in this question, we don't know the range of the numbers, but we know the range of the frequencies of each number, which is 1 through nums.length
     * Thus we use this frequency information as bucket index and construct an array of ArrayList to store numbers corresponding to each frequency. 
     * Then we just take out k element with top k frequency and return them. 
     */
    public List<Integer> topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length < k) return new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        List<Integer>[] bucket = new List[nums.length + 1];
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequency = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequency.put(num, frequency.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (int key : frequency.keySet()) {
            int freq = frequency.get(key);
            if (bucket[freq] == null) {
                bucket[freq] = new ArrayList<Integer>();
            }
            bucket[freq].add(key);
        }
        
        List<Integer> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int pos = bucket.length - 1; pos >= 0 && ret.size() < k; pos--) {
            if (bucket[pos] != null) {
                ret.addAll(bucket[pos]);
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
