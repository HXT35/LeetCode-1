This is essentially a base conversion question. What we want to do is to change a base 10 number to a base 26 number. However, notice there is no __0__ in the given examples. Thus we have to minus 1 for current digit each time as if we are treating `1 <==> A` as `0`.

Time: `O(n/26)`. 

Space `O(n/26)`.

```
class Solution {
    public String convertToTitle(int n) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (n != 0) {
            n = n - 1;
            int mod = n % 26;
            char curr = (char)('A' + mod);
            sb.append(curr);
            n = n / 26;
        }
        
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
