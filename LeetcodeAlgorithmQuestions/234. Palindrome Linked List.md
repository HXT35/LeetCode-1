Solution1: 1 pass with stack

In order to determine a palidrome, a stack is probably the most appropriate data strcture to use. Simply put a half of the elements into a stack and iterate through the other half to compare each element with the element popped from the stack.

Suppose the length of the LinkedList is `n`. 

Time complexity: `O(n)`. 

Space complexity: `O(n/2) = O(n)`. 

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            deque.push(slow.val);
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        if (fast != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        while (slow != null && slow.val == deque.pop()) {
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        return slow == null;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: 1 pass without extra space

In order to determine the palidrome without extra space, we need to reverse half of the LinkedList, of course. In order to do so, we first use 2 pointers to find the middle point of the LinkedList. During this proces, we reverse the first half of the LinkedList. Then we compare the first half with the second half from the middle point of the LinkedList. During this process, we reverse the LinkedList back. 

Suppose the length of the LinkedLis tis `n`.

Time complexity: `O(n)`.
Space complexity: `O(1)`. 

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode reverse = null;
        
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            ListNode tmp = slow.next;
            slow.next = reverse;
            reverse = slow;
            slow = tmp;
        }
        ListNode tail = fast == null ? slow : slow.next;
        boolean res = true;
        while (reverse != null) {
            res = res && reverse.val == tail.val;
            ListNode tmp = reverse.next;
            reverse.next = slow;
            slow = reverse;
            reverse = tmp;
            tail = tail.next;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```
