# Solution 2 pass straight forward solution

In order to find the index of the character that only appears once, we need to at least scan the input string once. This is the best conceivable time of this question. 

However, we want to find the first one of the character that only appears once, thus we need another iteration to find out which character, among those that only appear once, is the first. 

Time complexity: `O(2n) = O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.
Space complexity: `O(26) = O(1)` for storing the appearance of each character ranging from `'a'` to `'z'`. 

```
class Solution {
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        int[] existed = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            existed[c - 'a'] += 1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (existed[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
