# Solution1: `O(n)` push, `O(1)` pop 

Use 2 `Queue` to store the inserted elements. 

For `O(n)` push, use the following algorithm:  
1. For any new element, first insert it in `q2`.   
2. Then put any remaining element in `q1` to `q2`. Hence we are always putting new element on the first place of the queue.   
3. Then swap `q1` and `q2`. 

For `O(1)` pop, top and empty, use the following algorithm:

1. `pop() = q1.poll()`.   
2. `top() = q1.peek()`.   
3. `empty() = q1.isEmpty()`.  

```Java
class MyStack {
    Queue<Integer> q1;
    Queue<Integer> q2;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyStack() {
        q1 = new LinkedList();
        q2 = new LinkedList();
    }
    
    /** Push element x onto stack. */
    public void push(int x) {
        q2.add(x);
        while (!q1.isEmpty()) {
            q2.offer(q1.poll());
        }
        Queue<Integer> tmp = q1;
        q1 = q2;
        q2 = tmp;
    }
    
    /** Removes the element on top of the stack and returns that element. */
    public int pop() {
        return q1.poll();
    }
    
    /** Get the top element. */
    public int top() {
        return q1.peek();
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the stack is empty. */
    public boolean empty() {
        return q1.isEmpty();
    }
}

/**
 * Your MyStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyStack obj = new MyStack();
 * obj.push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.top();
 * boolean param_4 = obj.empty();
 */
```

# Solution2: One queue. `O(1)` push, `O(n)` pop. 

The above solution uses two queues to store the result. However, this could be solved with only one queue. Only that we need to poll every element from the queue and put it back each time we need to pop a new elelemt. This could be done using the following algorithm:

1. In order to offer an element, simply offer it in the end of the queue. And keep it in an int `top`.   
2. In order to pop an element, poll every element from it and offer it back at the end of the queue except for the last one. The remaining one is the one we want. poll it out and return.    

```Java
public void push(int x) {
    queue.offer(x);
}

public int pop() {
    int count = queue.size();
    while (count > 1) {
        queue.offer(queue.poll());
        count--;
    }
    return queue.poll();
}
```
