# Solution: HashMap indexing with BFS

Based on the description of this question, we can tell that it is essentially an Tree traversal problem. We can abstract the question into: Finding all the child nodes in the subtree rooted at given parent. 

This is a very typical problem and can be solved using standard tree traversal methods, e.g. BFS and DFS. 

Meanwhile, we need to demonstrate the tree, in some way, other than the 2 given lists in order to find out children of a given process efficiently. Otherwise, finding all children of a given process takes `O(n)` time where `n` is the length of the input list, which is way too slow. 

A `HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>>` is very convenient in this case for remembering the parent and child relationship because a child can only have 1 parent and a parent can have multiple children. 

Therefore, the algorithm can be described as following:    
1. Iterate the `pid` and `ppid` list and construct the mapping relationship in a `HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>>`.   
2. Using a Queue to perform a standard BFS and find out all the process in the subtree.   

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the input list since we only need to check each process once. 

Space complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the input list since we keep a map of size `n` and a queue of size `n`(in the worst case).  

Java implementation.

```Java
class Solution {
    /**
     * Basically a Tree traversal problem. 
     * Given the process we want to kill, find out all child processes under the subtree rooted at this process.
     */
    public List<Integer> killProcess(List<Integer> pid, List<Integer> ppid, int kill) {
        List<Integer> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < ppid.size(); i++) {
            if (map.get(ppid.get(i)) == null) {
                map.put(ppid.get(i), new ArrayList<Integer>());
            }
            map.get(ppid.get(i)).add(pid.get(i));
        }
        
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        deque.offer(kill);
        while (!deque.isEmpty()) {
            int curr = deque.poll();
            ret.add(curr);
            List<Integer> children = map.get(curr);
            if (children != null) {
                deque.addAll(children);
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
