# Solution1: HashMap + HashSet

First of all, we need to make sure we have considered of all the edge cases in this question. So there are 3 conditions for a word:   
1. There is no similar pair exists for this word.  
2. There is one pair exists for this word.  
3. There are more than one pair exists for this word.  

Considering about all the above conditions, we need to use a one to more relationship when storing the pair relationship. This can be realized via a `HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>` for quick (`O(1)`) search for a word's similar words.  

And based on the question, we have two conditions when the two input arrays are not similar:   
1. The two input array are of different length.  
2. For a word at position `i` in `words[]`, if this word does not exists in the HashMap or the HashSet corresponding to it does not contains `words2[i]`. Meanwhile, `words1[i] != words2[i]`.   

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the greater one among `words1.length` and `pairs.length`.  

Space complexity: `O(2*m) = O(m)` where `m` is the length of `pairs`.  

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean areSentencesSimilar(String[] words1, String[] words2, String[][] pairs) {
        if (words1.length != words2.length) return false;
        Map<String, Set<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (String[] pair : pairs) {
            if (!map.containsKey(pair[0])) {
                map.put(pair[0], new HashSet<>());
            }
            if (!map.containsKey(pair[1])) {
                map.put(pair[1], new HashSet<>());
            }
            map.get(pair[0]).add(pair[1]);
            map.get(pair[1]).add(pair[0]);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < words1.length; i++) {
            if (!words1[i].equals(words2[i]) && (!map.containsKey(words1[i]) || !map.get(words1[i]).contains(words2[i]))) {
                return false;
            }
            // if (words1[i].equals(words2[i])) continue;
            // if (map.containsKey(words1[i]) && map.get(words1[i]).contains(words2[i])) continue;
            // return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
