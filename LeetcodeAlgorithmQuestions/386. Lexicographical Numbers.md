# Solution1: DFS with a stack

This problem asks for lexicographical order of numbers until `n`. This process is similar to a DFS traversal of the following tree stucture from left to right:   

```
                root
         /         |     \
         1          2     3
      /  |\        /|\   /|\
     0   1 2      0 1 2 0 1 2
    / |  |\
   0  1  0       .........
```

Hence we can make use of a stack to perform a virtual DFS based on the similar process, while constructing numbers along with the traversal process, i.e. all numbers start with `1` first. Then all numbers whose left most digit is `1` and whose second left most digit is `0`, `1`, etc. 

Note, that here is a edge case, when `n ≤ 9`. In this case we cannot do a traversal with this implementation. In this case we just put `1` through `n` in the returned List. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` because we need to  check as many as `10n` numbers. 

Space complexity: `O(l)` where `l` is the number of digits in `n`. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        // get the number of digits in the input
        int len = 0;
        int num = n;
        while (num / 10 != 0) {
            len++;
            num = num / 10;
        }
        len++;
        
        List<Integer> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        
        if (n < 10) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                ret.add(i);
            }
            return ret;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
            Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();
            deque.push(i);
            for (int j = 2; j <= len; j++) {
                while (!deque.isEmpty()) {
                    int top = deque.pop();
                    ret.add(top);
                    for (int k = 9; k >= 0; k--) {
                        int tmp = top * 10 + k;
                        if (tmp <= n) {
                            deque.push(tmp);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Recursive DFS, quicker than _DFS with stack_

The idea is similar to the above solution, but instead of using a stack, we do the DFS via recursion, during which we optimize the process by pruning the un-needed branches in a early stop style. 

Time complexity: `O(n)`.

Space complexity: `O(1)` without the recursion stack. Or `O(l)` for the recursion stack memory. `l` is the number of digits in `n`. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        List<Integer> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            dfs(i, n, ret);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int start, int n, List<Integer> ret) {
        if (start > n) {
            return;
        }
        ret.add(start);
        for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
            if (start * 10 + i > n) {
                // early stop
                return;
            }
            dfs(start * 10 + i, n, ret);
        }
    }
}
```

# Solution3: Construct the numbers in fly based on DFS

Except for the above 2 typical DFS solution, there also exists an tricky solution in which we can optimize the space complexity to `O(1)` while still make sure the program runs in `O(n)` time. The algorithm is based on the following observation:

1. For each number `i`, its postdecessor can be:  
  1. i * 10    
  2. i + 1 if i % 10 != 9  
  3. i's right most digit that is not 9 when i % 10 == 9  
  
To understand the above situation, we take `45` as an example. The next number of `45` can be:   
1. 450 if `450 ≤ n`.  
2. 46 if `450 > n && 46 ≤ n`.  
3. `5` if `46 > n`.   

And if the number's right most digit is 9, then we need to find its right most digit that is not 9, take 399 as an example, 399's next number should be 4, which means that we need to divide the number by 10 until we find its right most digit, which is 3, and add 1 to it. 

Java implementation showed as following. 

Time complexity: `O(n)`. 

Space complexity: `O(1)`. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        List<Integer> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        int curr = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            ret.add(curr);
            if (curr * 10 <= n) {
                curr = curr * 10;
            } else if (curr % 10 != 9 && curr + 1 <= n) {
                curr = curr + 1;
            } else { // curr % 10 == 9
                while ((curr / 10) % 10 == 9) {
                    curr = curr / 10;
                }
                curr = curr / 10 + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
