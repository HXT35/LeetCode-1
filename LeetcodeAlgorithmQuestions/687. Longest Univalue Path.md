# Solution1: Recursion

The basic reasoning of this question is that:   
1. Keep a global variable to record the maximum we get along the way.  
2. Suppose the longest path is of composed of 2 parts, `leftCount` from root and `rightCount` from root.  
  1. If the `root.val` of current call is the same with the value of the left child, then we know that the leftCount is the count returned by calling the recursion function using `root.left` as the root.  
  2. Otherwise, `leftCount` should be `0`.  
  3. For `rightCount`, the condition is the same.  
3. Once we get `leftCount` and `rightCount`, the current path that passes `root` has a length of `leftCount + rightCount`. And we should update global `max` if necessary.  
4. The recursion function should return the longer counts from left and right, i.e. `Math.max(leftCount, rightCount)`, since the root of current `root` can only construct a path if and only if it has a value that is the same with the current `root`.  
5. Edge case should be when `root` is null, we should return `0`.  

Time complexity: `O(n)`where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.  

Space complexity: `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree.  

```Java
class Solution {
    int max;
    public int longestUnivaluePath(TreeNode root) {
        max = 0;
        findLongestUnivaluePath(root);
        return max;
    }
    
    private int findLongestUnivaluePath(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int leftCount = 0;
        int rightCount = 0;
        int left = findLongestUnivaluePath(root.left);
        int right = findLongestUnivaluePath(root.right);
        
        if (root.left != null && root.val == root.left.val) {
            leftCount = leftCount + left + 1;
        }
        if (root.right != null && root.val == root.right.val) {
            rightCount = rightCount + right + 1;
        }
        
        max = Math.max(max, leftCount + rightCount);
        return Math.max(leftCount, rightCount);
    }
}
```
