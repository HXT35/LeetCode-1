# Solution1 Brute force

Since we want to know if a permutation of s1 is a subsring of s2, a straight forward solution is to generate all permutations of `s1` and try to find it in `s2` by iterating through all substrings of `s2` of the same length. 

# Solution2 String concatenation with a sliding window

To generate all permutations of `s1` and then compare them with `s2` is inefficient, for sure. But how could we improve it? Considering that we only want to know if there is a match in `s2`, rather than the permutation itself, we can use __String concatenation__ to remember the information of `s1`. eg: for `ccaabb`, the concatenation is `a2b2c2`. And during the iteration of `s2`, we generate the concatenation of each substring of `s2` and compare it with s1's concatenation. 

However, we don't really need to generate s2 substring concatenation each time. We simple reduce the appearance of the character being removed out of the window by 1 and add 1 to the character newly added in the concatenation. 

Hence each time we move the window forward by 1 position, the operation is only `O(1)` time.

Time complexity: `O(m * n)` where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the number of  substrings of the same length with `s1` in `s2`. Because for each substring in `s2`, we need `O(m)` time to check if the concatenation is the same. 

Space complexity: `O(26) = O(1)`. 

Note we could also use a `int[]` to remember the concatenation. 

```
class Solution {
    /**
     * String concatenation with sliding window
     */
    public boolean checkInclusion(String s1, String s2) {
        if (s1.isEmpty()) return true;
        Map<Character, Integer> s1Map = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Integer> s2Map = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
            s1Map.put(c, 0);
            s2Map.put(c, 0);
        }
        
        // get the concatenation of s1
        for (char c : s1.toCharArray()) {
            s1Map.put(c, s1Map.get(c) + 1);
        }
        
        // using a window to slide through s2 to get the matching
        for (int i = 0; i < s2.length(); i++) {
            if (i >= s1.length()) {
                s2Map.put(s2.charAt(i - s1.length()), s2Map.get(s2.charAt(i - s1.length())) - 1);
            }
            s2Map.put(s2.charAt(i), s2Map.get(s2.charAt(i)) + 1);
            if (s1Map.equals(s2Map)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```
