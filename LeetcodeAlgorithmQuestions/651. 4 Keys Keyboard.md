# Solution1 Recursively search for max

The base stone of solving this question lies in the fact that: if after i steps we get x number of A, than the max number of A we can get based on this is `(N - i - 2 + 1) * x`. 

And the base cases are when `N <= 3`, the max number of A is `N`. 

Based on this we can get the following recursive solution.

Time Complexity: for one round of iteration with input `n`, the time for i`1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = O(n^2)`. Thus the total time is `1^2 + 2^2 + ... + N^2 = O(N^3)`.

Space Complexity: `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int maxA(int N) {
        int max = N;
        for (int i = 3; i < N; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, maxA(i) * (N - i - 1));
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

# Solution2 Dynamic Programming

The above solution did a lot of redundant work by checking the result of `i` again and again. We can use an array to remember that and make the process more efficient. We can remember the results greedily, i.e. only remember the greatest result for each step since this is the only solution that influences the result. 

Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`. 

Space Complexity: `O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int maxA(int N) {
        int[] dp = new int[N + 1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
            dp[i] = i;
            for (int j = 3; j <= i; j++) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] * (i - j - 1));
            }
        }
        
        return dp[N];
    }
}
```
