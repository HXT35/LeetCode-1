# Solution1: Brute force solution

Move the elements in the array back by 1 each time. Suppose the input `nums[]` array has a length of `n`. And we will complete the rotate process within `k%n` rounds. In each round we move `n` elements, which takes `O(n)` time. Hence this algorithm has an upper runtime bound of `O(n^2)` time.

Time complexity: `O(n^2)`. 

Space complexity: `O(1)`. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k %= nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int prev = nums[nums.length - 1];
            for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
                int tmp = nums[j];
                nums[j] = prev;
                prev = tmp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Rotate with an extra array

Using an extra array to store the final result would be much easier. Simply put the current element in the position it's supposed to be in the extra array and iterate all elements in `nums[]` in this style. Suppose `nums.length = n`. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` since it takes `O(1)` for each number and there is `n` numbers in total. 

Space complexity: `O(n)`. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] extra = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            extra[(i + k) % nums.length] = nums[i];
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            nums[i] = extra[i];
        }
    }
}
```

# Solutionn3: Replace each element cyclically

This idea is still straightforward. Since we want to rotate the array forward by `k`, we simply put every element forward by `k`, and do this for all `nums.length = n` elements.  The tricky part of this algorithm is that it does not work if the array has a even length. In this case, we will always come back to the original position where we start the iteration in the array, a.k.a, we have a infinite loop. To solve this, we start the iteration again from the position followed by the previous one where we start the iteration once we reach it again. And we will get the final result after we perform `count = nums.length = n` movings, since each time we move one element to the right position and there is `nums.length` element in total. 

Time complexity: `O(n)`

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k %= nums.length;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; count < nums.length; i++) {
            int curr = i;
            int prev = nums[i];
            do {
                int next = (curr + k) % nums.length;
                int tmp = nums[next];
                nums[next] = prev;
                prev = tmp;
                count++;
                curr = next;
            } while (curr != i);
        }
    }
}
```

# Solution4: Reverse List

However, if we rotate the array by `k` times, `k` elements from the tail of the array will be moved to the front of the array __(1)__. And the remaining `nums.length - k` elements will be moved backwards __(2)__. Hence we can reverse the whole array first. Then we reverse the first `k` elements, which satisfies the __(1)__ statement. Following that, we reverse the remaining `n - k` elements, which satisfis the __(2)__ statement. 

Time complexity: `O(n)`

Space complexity: `O(n)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k %= nums.length;
        reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
        reverse(nums, k, nums.length - 1);
    }
    
    public void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int tmp = nums[start];
            nums[start] = nums[end];
            nums[end] = tmp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
