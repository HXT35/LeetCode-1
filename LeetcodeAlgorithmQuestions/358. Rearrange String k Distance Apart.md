# Solution1: Priority Queue based greedy search

In order to complete the rearrangement for the original string, we need to always consider about the character with the highest frequency first because this is our best bet to construct the result. Hence this is a greedy algorithm. 

For the purpose to get the character with highest frequency easily, we can make use of a max heap sorted based on the frequency of the characters in `s`. Consider that there might exists two character with the same frequency, we need to add an extra comparison setp in the comparator, that is, when 2 characters have the same frequency, we sort them alphabetically. This way we can aoivd the undefinite behavior in Java's PriorityQueue when 2 values in it have the same rank.  

Meanwhile, we have to also keep a FIFO queue to store all the characters that have been added but is frozen right now because of the `k` distance limitation. We can only add them back to the max heap when we have passed `k` steps, i.e. there are `k` entries in the wait queue.   

Hence we have the following implementation.  

Time complexity: `O(nlogn)` since we have to perform the `poll` and `offer` on the queue `n` times each given that there is `n` characters in `s` in total.   

Space complexity: `O(26) = O(1)`  

```Java
class Solution {
    public String rearrangeString(String s, int k) {
        int len = s.length();
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            map.put(s.charAt(i), map.getOrDefault(s.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Initialize a max heap sorted based on the frequency of the characters
        // For two characters with the same frequency, sort based on alphabetical order
        Queue<Map.Entry<Character, Integer>> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
            if (a.getValue() == b.getValue()) {
                return a.getKey().compareTo(b.getKey());
            }
            return b.getValue().compareTo(a.getValue());
        });
        
        Queue<Map.Entry<Character, Integer>> waitQueue = new LinkedList<>();
        maxHeap.addAll(map.entrySet());
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            Map.Entry<Character, Integer> entry = maxHeap.poll();
            sb.append(entry.getKey());
            entry.setValue(entry.getValue() - 1);
            waitQueue.offer(entry);
            
            // need to wait for distance k
            if (waitQueue.size() < k) {
                continue;
            }
            
            Map.Entry<Character, Integer> front = waitQueue.poll();
            if (front.getValue() > 0) {
                maxHeap.offer(front);
            }
        }
        
        return sb.length() == s.length() ? sb.toString() : "";
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Two array for frequency and next valid position

Since this is a greedy question, for sure we need to consider placing the characters with higher frequencies first. Thus we first construct a map between characters and their corresponding frequencies. Meanwhile, since the same character must be at least distance `k` from each other, we keep another map between each character and their next valid position, say we have put `'a'` at index `i`, then the next valid position of `'a'` should be greater than or equal to `i + k`.   

During the process we iterate through the input String, we first get the first character among `'a'` to `'z'` that satisfy:   
1. It has the highest frequency among the remaining characters.  
2. Current index we are considering is at least distance `k` from the previous position of this character, that is to say, the next valid position of this character should be less than or equal to current index.   

If we cannot find a match, that means a result satisfies the question requirement is not possible, return `""`.  

Otherwise, we reduce frequency of current character by 1 and update its next valid position.  

Time complexity: `O(26*n) = O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.  

Space complexity: `O(26) = O(1)`  

```Java
class Solution {
    public String rearrangeString(String s, int k) {
        int len = s.length();
        int[] count = new int[26];
        int[] nextPosition = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            count[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int index = 0; index < len; index++) {
            int candidate = findCandidate(count, nextPosition, index);
            if (candidate == -1) return "";
            count[candidate]--;
            nextPosition[candidate] = index + k;
            sb.append((char)('a' + candidate));
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    private int findCandidate(int[] count, int[] nextPosition, int index) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int candidate = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < count.length; i++) {
            if (count[i] > 0 && count[i] > max && index >= nextPosition[i]) {
                max = count[i];
                candidate = i;
            }
        }
        
        return candidate;
    }
}
```
