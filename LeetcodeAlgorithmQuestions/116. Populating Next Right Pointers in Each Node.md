# Solution1: Recursion solution

The edge case is that when the node is the rightmost node of each level, we need to set the `next` pointer to `null` rather than the right node within the same level. However, sinde the `next` pointer is set to `null` originally, this is not an edge case. We just leave it as is. 

Hence we can do it in the old school way: Recursion, just like most tree question. 

We set the `next` pointer level by level recursively. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes. 

Space complexity: `O(1)` without recursion stack. Otherwise `O(n)`. 

```
public class Solution {
    public void connect(TreeLinkNode root) {
        if (root == null || (root.left == null && root.right == null)) {
            return;
        }
        root.left.next = root.right;
        if (root.next != null) {
            root.right.next = root.next.left;
        }
        
        connect(root.left);
        connect(root.right);
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Iteration with `O(1)` space. 

If we want to do it in excat `O(1)` space, we need to do it iteratively.     
Since we are changing the `next` pointer from left to right, we can do this in a level by level style.    
In each level, from left to right, we change the `next` of `left` if `left` is not `null`, and change the `next` of `right` if `next` of current node is not `null`.    
Then we do so for next level's left most node. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of tree nodes. 

Space complexity: `O(1)`. 

```
public class Solution {
    public void connect(TreeLinkNode root) {
        TreeLinkNode levelStart = root;
        while (levelStart != null) {
            TreeLinkNode curr = levelStart;
            while (curr != null) {
                if (curr.left != null) curr.left.next = curr.right;
                if (curr.right != null && curr.next != null) curr.right.next = curr.next.left;
                curr = curr.next;
            }
            levelStart = levelStart.left;
        }
    }
}
```

# Solution3: Using a Queue to perform BFS

Use a queue to perform a BFS search.    
During BFS, change the `next` pointers with in each level correspondingly. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of tree nodes.

Space complexity: `O(n/2) = O(n)` since the queue can be as large as the last level. 

```
public Solution {
    public void connect(TreeLinkNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;
        Queue<TreeLinkNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int length = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
                TreeLinkNode curr = queue.poll();
                if (i == length - 1) {
                    curr.next = null;
                }
                else {
                    curr.next = queue.peek();
                }
                if (curr.left != null && curr.right != null) {
                    queue.offer(curr.left);
                    queue.offer(curr.right);
                }
            }
        }

    }
}
```
