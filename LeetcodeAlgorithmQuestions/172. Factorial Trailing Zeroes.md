# Solution1: Iteration 

Since we want to know how many trailing zeros are there, we are basically look for tens in the `n!`'s equation. And 10 is the product of 2 and 5, thus we should actually looking for the minimum number of 2 and 5. However, the number of multiple of 5 is definitely more than the number of multiple of 2, hence the number of zeros is dominant by the number of 5. 

Each multiple of `5^1` will provide one 5, and each multiple of `5^2` will provide two 5s and so on. 

Thus we have the basic solution as following:

```
return n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + n/625 + n/3125 + ...;
```

Time complexity: `O(log_5(n) = O(logn)`

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            count += n / 5;
            n = n / 5;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Recursion

Same idea as above. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        return n == 0 ? 0 : n / 5 + trailingZeroes(n / 5);
    }
}
```
