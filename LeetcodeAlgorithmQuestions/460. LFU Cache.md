# Solution1: HashMap + TreeMap

In order to keep track of the cache whose size if `k`, we need to keep some kind of sorting information based on the frequency of the `(key, value)` entry. Meanwhile, based on the requirement of the question, when the frequency is the same, we should sort based on the timestamp of the entry such that the least recently used entry is evicted.  

Hence we use one HashMap to store the `(key, (value, frequency, stamp))` information as the cache. And a TreeMap to store the `((value, frequency, stamp), key)` information sorted based on frequency and stamp, for keeping the sequency of the cache and evict the least ranked entry if needed. 

Each time we get a `value` based on `key`, we increase the `frequency` by 1. And each time we put a new `(key, value)` pair into the cache, there are 2 possible conditions:  
1. If the `key` already exists in our cache, we need to increase its `frequency` by 1 and store its new `value`.  
2. If the `key` does not already exists in our cache, we need to check the size of our cache.  
  1. If the size is less than `capacity`, we can put the entry into cache directly.   
  2. Otherwise, we need to first remove the lease ranked entry based on our sorting algorithm, and then put in the new entry.  
  
Time complexity: `O(logn)` for both put and get where `n` is the size of the capacity.   

Space complexity: `O(n)`.

# Solution2: `O(1)` for both operation

If we want to increase the time complexity of both put and get to `O(1)`, we need to remember some extra information.  

In order to solve this problem, we could use a method similar to bucket sort, where we keep track of keys corresponding to each frequency separately. And meanwhile, we also need to keep the chronological information, hence we use a LinkedHashSet to store the keys for each frequency. Newly added keys would be at the last positions. We also keep a `min` value to track the minimum bucket we currently have.  

For `get`, we first get the old frequency from the frequency map and add one to it. This means we need to move its key to bucket `frequency + 1` as well. Meanwhile, we have to update the `min` if needed. 

For `put`, the conditions are still similar:  
1. If the `key` is in the cache already, we need to update its frequency and value as needed. The updating process can be done via a `get`.  
2. Otherwise, there are 2 conditions:  
  1. if the size of the cache is less than the capacity, we put the `(key, value)` pair in cache directly and put this `key` in the bucket `1`.  
  2. Otherwise, we need to remove the first `key` in the bucket `min`, as well as remove the `key` from `frequency` map and `cache` map. 
  then we can put the new `(key, value)` pair with frequency `1` in the 3 maps.  
  
Time complexity: `O(1)` for both put and get. 

Space complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the capacity. 

```Java
class LFUCache {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> frequency;  // (key, frequency)
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> cache; // (key, value)
    HashMap<Integer, LinkedHashSet<Integer>> freqMap; // (frequency, (key1, key2, ...))

    int min;

        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.frequency = new HashMap<>();
        this.cache = new HashMap<>();
        this.freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        this.freqMap.put(1, new LinkedHashSet<Integer>());
        this.min = 0;
    }
    
    public int get(int key) {
        if (capacity <= 0 || cache.get(key) == null) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // increase the frequency of current key by 1
        int oldFreq = frequency.getOrDefault(key, 0);
        frequency.put(key, oldFreq + 1);
        freqMap.get(oldFreq).remove(key);
        if (oldFreq == min && freqMap.get(oldFreq).size() == 0) {
            min++;
        }
        if (!freqMap.containsKey(oldFreq + 1)) {
            freqMap.put(oldFreq + 1, new LinkedHashSet<Integer>());
        }
        freqMap.get(oldFreq + 1).add(key);
        
        return cache.get(key);
    }
    
    public void put(int key, int value) {
        if (capacity <= 0) return;
        // if the key already exists
        if (cache.containsKey(key)) {
            cache.put(key, value);
            get(key);
            return;
        }
        
        // remove the one with the lease frequency and add the new one in cache
        // if the cache exceeds the capacity
        if (cache.size() >= capacity) {
            int oldKey = freqMap.get(min).iterator().next();
            freqMap.get(min).remove(oldKey);
            frequency.remove(oldKey);
            cache.remove(oldKey);
        }
        cache.put(key, value);
        frequency.put(key, 1);
        min = 1;
        freqMap.get(min).add(key);
    }
