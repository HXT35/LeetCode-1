# Solution1 Na√Øve approach

Use a n*n array to represent the playground. Put 1 and 2 on the corresponding position when player1 and player make move. 

Meanwhile, keep a counter for the number of moves each player has already made to improve efficiency. If the counter is less than n, we don't even need to check for win condition cause that is impossible. 

For each movement a player made, first check for its validity. If it is a legal move, then we increase the counter of that player. When the counter is greater than or equal to n, than we check for horizontal, vertical and 2 diagonals for win condition. If there is some position that has already been taken by the other player during checking, we stop early to improve efficiency. 

This lead to the following algorithm. 

Time complexity: `O(4*n) = O(n)` for each move, since we are checking `4*n` positions in the worst case for win condition. 
Space complexity: `O(n^2)` for the playground array.

    int[][] playground;
    int[] count;
    int n;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        this.playground = new int[n][n];
        // number of moves made by each player. 
        // if count < n, no need to check win condition.
        this.count = new int[2];
        this.n = n;
    }

# Solution2 Not saving any redundant info, improve to O(1) time O(n) space
 
Actually if we want to know if a player win or not, we don't need to check every single position on the playground. All we need is to know the number of moves this player had on the corresponding row, column and diagonal.

Thus we can only save these needed information in the solution to improve both the time and space complexity. By needed information, we means the count for each row, column and diagonal.

Time complexity: `O(1)` since we save the count and we check for win condition in `O(1)` time.
Space complexity: `O(2*n) = O(n)` since we are using 1 dimensional arrays only.

```
class TicTacToe {
    int[][] rows;
    int[][] cols;
    int[][] diag;
    int n;
    int playerNum = 2;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        this.n = n;
        this.rows = new int[n][playerNum];
        this.cols = new int[n][playerNum];
        this.diag = new int[2][playerNum];
    }
    
    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.

        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.

    public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        rows[row][player - 1]++;
        cols[col][player - 1]++;
        if (row == col) diag[0][player - 1]++;
        if (row + col == n - 1) diag[1][player - 1]++;
        if (rows[row][player - 1] == n || cols[col][player - 1] == n 
            || diag[0][player - 1] == n || diag[1][player - 1] == n) {
            return player;
        }
        
        return 0;
