# Solution1: Using HashMap

In order for the permutation of `s` to be a palindrome, there could be 2 conditions:   
1. If the `s` contains even numbr of characters in it, then every single character need to appear for an even number of times in order for a permutation of s to be palindrome, for they need to be symmetric. E.g. `"aabb"` to `"abba"`.   
2. If `s` contains odd number of characters in it, then every single character need to appear for an even number of times, except for one. In other words, there could be only one character in `s` that appears for an odd number of times. And we should put this character in the center of the resulting palindrome. E.g. `"aab"` to `"aba"`.  

Summarize the 2 condition up, we have that: __There number of characters that appear for an odd number of times in `s` should be less than or equal to 1__.   

Hence we have the following HashMap solution naturally, in which we first count every unique characters in `s`, and then we check for the number of characters that appear for an odd number of times.  

Suppose there is `n` characters in `s`.  

Time complexity: `O(2*n) = O(n)`.

Space complexity: `O(n)`.  

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPermutePalindrome(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int numOfOdd = 0;
        for (char c : map.keySet()) {
            if (map.get(c) % 2 != 0) {
                numOfOdd++;
            }
        }
        
        // return (s.length() % 2 == 0 && numOfOdd == 0) || (s.length() % 2 != 0 && numOfOdd == 1);
        return numOfOdd <= 1;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Iterate through all ASCII characters

Considering that there is only 128 characters in the ASCII table, we could possibly iterate through each one of it and count how many of them are in `s`. Furthermore we will record the total number of characters that appear for an odd number of times. 

Time complexity: `O(128*n)=O(n)`

Space complexity: `O(1)`  

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPermutePalindrome(String s) {
        int numOfOdd = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {
                if (s.charAt(j) == i) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            numOfOdd += (count % 2);
        }
        
        return numOfOdd <= 1;
    }
}
```
