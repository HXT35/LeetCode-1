# Solution: Trie based search

For searching words/sentences based on prefix, the intuitive solution would be using Trie, or prefix tree. Thus for all the inputs, we could build a Trie out of them. Additionally, since we want to return the results based on frequency, we add a `times` field to each TrieNode to keep track of this information. 

And for all the matched results, we construct another class called `Sentence`, in which contains the matched sentence and the number of its occurance. Then we sort this list based on the criteria described in the question: 1. for sentences of the same frequency, sort based on alphabetical order. 2. for sentences of different frequency, sort based on frequency. This can be done by using `Collections.sort()` with a customized `comparator`. 

Hence we have the following solution.

Time Complexity:      
`AutocompleteSystem()`: For `k` input sentences each with length `l`, the constructor takes `O(k*l)` time.      
`input()`: Suppose there is `n` nodes in the Trie and the number of matching is `m`, this setp takes `O(n+mlogm)` time. 

Space Complexity:    
Suppose there is a total of `x` characters being stored, then the space is `O(x)`. 

```
class AutocompleteSystem {
    class Sentence {
        String sentence;
        int occurrence;
        
        Sentence(String sentence, int occurrence) {
            this.sentence = sentence;
            this.occurrence = occurrence;
        }
    }
    
    class TrieNode {
        TrieNode[] children;
        int times;
        boolean isEnd;
        char c;
        
        TrieNode(char c) {
            this.c = c;
            this.children = new TrieNode[27]; // char a to z plus space
        }
    }

    public AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times) {
