# Solution1: Constructing result via stringBuilder

The tricky part of this question is that we don't know how long will the first group be. And we will only know this after we have constructed all the remaining gropus. Hence it would be easier to build the result from end to beginning. And we will keep constructing gropus until there is less than `K` characters left in the input. Meanwhile, we need to put a `'-'` between every gropus, which is realized by appending a dash each time we have put `K` characters from the original input to the output.  

Note that in order to build the result, we also iterate from the end of the input to the beginning.  

An edge case of this question would be when the input only contains `'-'`, e.g. `S = "----"`. In this case we just check the result we built. 

Another point we need to pay attention to is the reason why we don't need to check for if we added an extra `'-'` in the result. This case will only occur when the input contains a integer times of characters to `K`. However, since we will only check for if we should add an `'-'` in the next round, we are safe for the extra `'-'`. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `S`.  

Space complexity: `O(n)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public String licenseKeyFormatting(String S, int K) {
        if (K <= 0) {
            // invalid case
            return "";
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        char[] charS = S.toCharArray();

        for (int i = charS.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (charS[i] == '-') continue;
            if (sb.length() % (K + 1) == K) {
                sb.append('-');
            }
            sb.append(Character.toUpperCase(charS[i]));
        }
        // if (sb.length() != 0 && sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1) == '-') sb.delete(sb.length() - 1, sb.length());
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
