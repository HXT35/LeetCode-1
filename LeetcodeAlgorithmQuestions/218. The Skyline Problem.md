# Solution Using Priority to keep track of the current max height

In order to find the critical points of the skylines, we can abstract the buildings to be a sequence of segments with 3 attributes: start point, stop point and height. And what we need to do is to scan from left to right and find out the max height at each critical points. 

And we have the following observation:      
1. When you reach a start point, the height of current building immediately takes effect which means it could possibly affect the contour  or hadow others when mixed with other following buildings;    
2. When you reach a end point, the height of current building will stop its influences;      
3. Our target exists at the position where height change happens and there is nothing above it shadowing it;      

To defind a shadow relationship:    
1. The building shadows current position must have a start point smaller than or equal to current position.      
2. The building shadows current position must have a height greater than current position.
3. The building shadows current position must have a stop position greater than current position. 

Thus we have the following algorithm that scans from left to right based x axis.  

1. Visit all start points and all end points in order;
2. When visiting a point, we need to know whether it is a start point or a end point, based on which we can add a height or delete a height from our data structure.

To achieve this, we using the following method:     
1. Using an `int[][]` to collect all `[startPoint, -height]` and `[endPoint, height]` pairs.     
2. Sort it, first based on first value, then based on second value. By keeping all the start points' height as negative value, we guaranteed that start points showed up earlier than end points.    

Then we sacn the points based on following rules:     
1. If the point is a start point, indicated by it has a negative height, we add it to a max heap. If the point is an end point, we delete it from the max heap.     
2. If 2 points have the same x value, higher one will shadow lower one. 

Suppose there is `n` buildings in the input.

Time complexity: `O(n^2)` time because `heap.remove()` takes `O(n)` time each. 

Space complexity: `O(n)` space. 

```
class Solution {
    public List<int[]> getSkyline(int[][] buildings) {
        List<int[]> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        List<int[]> heights = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int[] building : buildings) {
            // Add start points to the list
            heights.add(new int[]{building[0], -building[2]});
            // Add end points to the list
            heights.add(new int[]{building[1], building[2]});
        }
        
        Collections.sort(heights, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[0] != b[0]) {
                return a[0] - b[0];
            }
            return a[1] - b[1];
        });
        
        // Use a max heap to store the heights
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
            return b.compareTo(a);
        });
        // Provide a initial value to make steps consistent when there is no building
        maxHeap.offer(0);
        // At the beginning point, the height is 0
        int prev = 0;
        
        for (int[] height : heights) {
            if (height[1] < 0) {  // This is a start point
                maxHeap.offer(-height[1]);
            } else {  // This is an end point
                maxHeap.remove(height[1]);
            }
            
            // Compare current max height with previous max height, update previous height and result if necessary
            int curr = maxHeap.peek();
            if (prev != curr) {
                ret.add(new int[]{height[0], curr});
                prev = curr;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

## Using a TreeMap instead of the PriorityQueue to improve the performance

`PriorityQueue.remove()` takes `O(n)` time. But `TreeMap.remove()` only takes `O(logn)` time. Thus we can use TreeMap to track the heights. The only thing that need to take into consideration is that in TreeMap we cannot have duplicate objects, thus we use a `<height, count>` pairs to keep track of the pairs. If `count` reaches 0, we delete this height. 

```
public class Solution {
    public List<int[]> getSkyline(int[][] buildings) {
        List<int[]> heights = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] b: buildings) {
            heights.add(new int[]{b[0], - b[2]});
            heights.add(new int[]{b[1], b[2]});
        }
        Collections.sort(heights, (a, b) -> (a[0] == b[0]) ? a[1] - b[1] : a[0] - b[0]);
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> heightMap = new TreeMap<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        heightMap.put(0,1);
        int prevHeight = 0;
        List<int[]> skyLine = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int[] h: heights) {
            if (h[1] < 0) {
                Integer cnt = heightMap.get(-h[1]);
                cnt = ( cnt == null ) ? 1 : cnt + 1;
                heightMap.put(-h[1], cnt);
            } else {
                Integer cnt = heightMap.get(h[1]);
                if (cnt == 1) {
                    heightMap.remove(h[1]);
                } else {
                    heightMap.put(h[1], cnt - 1);
                }
            }
            int currHeight = heightMap.firstKey();
            if (prevHeight != currHeight) {
                skyLine.add(new int[]{h[0], currHeight});
                prevHeight = currHeight;
            }
        }
        return skyLine;
    }
}
```
