# Solution1: Count and write 

Use separate pointers `read` and `write` to keep track of where we are reading and where the position we should write is. And we will traverse the `char[]` from left to right, while reading contiguous group of characters and writing compressed version if necessary. At the end, the position of the `write` head will be the length of the answer that was written. 

We maintain a `count` to record the number of appearance for the current character pointed by `read - 1`. Thus whenever `chars[read] != chars[read - 1]` and `count > 1`, we know that there is a compressed group we should write to the `chars[]` starts from `write`. 

And meanwhile, if `read == chars.length`, we know that we have checked all characters in `chars[]` and we should write the final group, were it be one character or a group of characters, to the `chars[]` array starts from `write`.  

Time complexity: `O(n)` 

Space complexity: `O(1)` 

```Java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        if (chars.length <= 1) {
            return chars.length;
        }
        int count = 1;
        int write = 0;
        int read = 1;
        while (read <= chars.length) {
            if (read == chars.length || chars[read] != chars[read - 1]) {
                chars[write++] = chars[read - 1];
                if (count > 1) {
                    String digits = String.valueOf(count);
                    for (char digit : digits.toCharArray()) {
                        chars[write++] = digit;
                    }
                }
                count = 1;
            } else {
                count++;
            }
            read++;
        }
        
        return write;
    }
}
```
