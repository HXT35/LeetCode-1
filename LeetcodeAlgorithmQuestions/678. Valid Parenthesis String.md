# Analysis

## Solution1

The idea is to use an int `count` to keep tracking the relationship between left parenthesis and right parenthesis since we don't care about the exact parenthesis but rather their corresponding counts. 

For every character in the input `String s`, there are 3 possible conditions:

1. Current character is `'('`, then we increase the `count`.

2. Current character is `')'`, then we decrease the `count`.

3. Current character is `'*'`, there are 3 possible sub-conditions:
   - Treat `*` as `(`, increase `count` by 1.
   - Treat `*` as `)`, decrease `count` by 1.
   - Treat `*` as empty string, count does not change. 
   
### Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is `O(1)` without considering the recursion stack. The recursion stack space would be linear to the length of the input String. 

The time complexity would be `O(n)` as well. Worst case `O(2^n)` to `O(3^n)` when the input string contains only `*`.

Suppose `n` is the length of the input string.

Then we have the following solution based on straight-forwardly implement the above thoughts.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.isEmpty() || s.length() == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        
        char[] charS = s.toCharArray();
        return checkValidStringHelper(charS, 0, 0);
    }
    
    private boolean checkValidStringHelper(char[] charS, int start, int count) {
        // Base case
        if (start == charS.length) {
            return count == 0 ? true : false;
        }
        
        // If the count smaller than 0, early stop cause this is invalid.
        if (count < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        if (charS[start] == '(') {
            return checkValidStringHelper(charS, start + 1, count + 1);
        } else if (charS[start] == ')') {
            return checkValidStringHelper(charS, start + 1, count - 1);
        } else { // charS[start] == '*'
            // 1. treat '*' as empty string
            boolean ret1 = checkValidStringHelper(charS, start + 1, count);
            // 2. treat '*' as left parenthesis
            boolean ret2 = checkValidStringHelper(charS, start + 1, count + 1);
            // 3. treat '*' as right parenthesis
            boolean ret3 = checkValidStringHelper(charS, start + 1, count - 1);
            
            return (ret1 || ret2 || ret3);
        }
    }
}
```

## Solution2 (More optimal)

Another interesting observation is that the resulting count will actually be a continuous sequence of integer. 

E.g., for input `"(**))"`

At step 1, the count would be 1.

At step 2, the count would be 0, 1, or 2

At step 3, the count would be `0+1, 0, 0-1, 1+1, 1, 1-1, 2+1, 2, 2-1`, which is `-1, 0, 1, 2, 3`. And since negative count is always invalid, we early stop for these conditions.  ==> `0, 1, 2, 3`.

At step 4, the count would be `0, 1, 2` with early pruning.

At step 5, the count would be `0, 1` with early pruning. 

Considering that actually the reslut count is a consecutive sequence of integers, we can actually stores only the range of the output rather than iterate through all possible conditions. 

### Complexity
This algorithm runs in `O(1)` space and `O(n)` time where `n` is the length of the input string.

Resulting to the following solution:

```
class Solution {
    public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.isEmpty() || s.length() == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        
        int low = 0;
        int high = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') {
                high++;
                low++;
            } else if (c == ')') {
                if (low > 0) {
                    low--;
                }
                high--;
            } else { //c == '*'
                if (low > 0) {
                    low--;
                }
                high++;
            }
            
            if (high < 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // Since we have pruned all conditions where low is smaller than 0, the smallest low would be 0
        // if the input string is valid.
        return low == 0;
    }
}
```
