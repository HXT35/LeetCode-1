# Solution O(1) space solution

By intuition, this is kinda like 2 people running on a track at different speed. If the track has cycle, they are going to meet each other finally. If the track does not have cycle, then they are not going to meet each other. Similarly, we can have 2 pointers moving at different speed on the LinkedList and check if the 2 pointers meet or not. 

Suppose the length of the LinkedList is `n`.

Time complexity: `O(n)`.

Space complexity: `O(1)`.

```
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head.next;
        while (slow != fast) {
            if (fast == null || fast.next == null) return false;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
