# Solution1: Use ArrayList as stack while keep an extra list for storing minimum
Do push(), pop() and top() in O(1) is easy. However, we need to think of how to do getMin() in O(1).
Use the idea from cumulative sum, we could do getMin() in O(1) with cumulative minimum list. 
Thus we use a list to store the minimum until every position. 
And each time we push() an element in the stack, update the minimum until current position if necessary. 
Each time we pop() an element, remove the last minimum from the list if the minimum is being popped.
In this way we we could do all operation in O(1) time. 

Time complexity: `O(1)` for `push`, `pop`, `top` and `getMin`.

Space complexity: `O(n)`. while `n` is the number of elements.

```
class MinStack {
    private List<Integer> stack;
    private List<Integer> minStack;

    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    public MinStack() {
        stack = new ArrayList<>();
        minStack = new ArrayList<>();
    }
    
    public void push(int x) {
        stack.add(x);
        if (minStack.isEmpty() || minStack.get(minStack.size() - 1) >= x) {
            minStack.add(x);
        }
    }
    
    public void pop() {
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            return;
        }
        int curr = stack.get(stack.size() - 1);
        stack.remove(stack.size() - 1);
        
        // remove current minimum from the minStack if current number being popped is the minimum.
        if (curr == minStack.get(minStack.size() - 1)) {
            minStack.remove(minStack.size() - 1);
        }
    }
    
    public int top() {
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            return;
        }
        return stack.get(stack.size() - 1);
    }
    
    public int getMin() {
        return minStack.get(minStack.size() - 1);
    }
}
```

# Solution2 

However, we could save the extra O(n) place used for the list of minimum. 

The idea is to store the gap between every value and current minimum. 

For `push()`, there are 2 conditions:       
1. the gap is positive. In this case current value is greater than minimum until now. We don't have to update minimum.    
2. the gap is negative. In this case current value is less than minimum. Thus we have to update the minimum.    

For `pop()`, there are 2 conditions as well.    
1. Gap is positive, remove the element directly without changing minimum.    
2. Gap is negative, minimum is current element. once pop it out, we have to update the minimum to be `minimum + Math.abs(gap)`.   
 
`top()` is similar to `pop()`.   

`getMin()` is simple, just return the minimum we stored. 
 
The reason to store numbers and minimum with long is to prevent overflow. Since we are storing gaps, `0 - Integer.MIN_VALUE` could lead to overflow. 

```
public class MinStack {
    Deque<Long> stack;
    long min; 
    
    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    public MinStack() {
        stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    }
    
    public void push(int x) {
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            stack.push(0L);
            min = x;
        } else {
            stack.push(x - min);
            if (x - min < 0) {
                min = x;
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void pop() {
        if (stack.isEmpty()) return;
        
        long gap = stack.pop();
        if (gap < 0) {
            min = min - gap; //if gap is negative, update minimum
        }
    }
    
    public int top() {
        long gap = stack.peek();
        
        if (gap > 0) {
            return (int)(gap + min);
        } else {
            return (int)min;
        }
    }
    
    public int getMin() {
        return (int)min;
    }
}

/**
 * Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MinStack obj = new MinStack();
 * obj.push(x);
 * obj.pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.top();
 * int param_4 = obj.getMin();
 */
```
