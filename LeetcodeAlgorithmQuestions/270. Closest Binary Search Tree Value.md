# Solution1 Iterative solution

Since it is a binary search tree, we can search for the closest number in a binary search style. And during this process, we keep track of the closest value we have met until there is no more child nodes. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int closestValue(TreeNode root, double target) {
        // Since we are guaranteed to have only one unique value closest to the target
        // We assume the input is always valid
        int ret = root.val;
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while (curr != null) {
            if (Math.abs(target - (double)curr.val) < Math.abs(target - (double)ret)) {
                ret = curr.val;
            }
            curr = target > (double) curr.val ? curr.right : curr.left;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution2 Recursive solution

```
class Solution {
    public int closestValue(TreeNode root, double target) {
        int ret = root.val;
        root = root.val > target ? root.left : root.right;
        if (root == null) {
            return ret;
        }
        int tmpRet = closestValue(root, target);
        return Math.abs(ret - target) > Math.abs(tmpRet - target) ? tmpRet : ret;
    }
}
```
