# Solution1 Sloving any common ancestor issue for Binary Tree

Considering the recursive feature of a binary tree, we could solve this with recursion, i.e. checking the left subtree, right subtree and curr TreeNode recursively. During the recursion, there are several conditions during this process, which are also the cases we need to check during the recursion. THose conditions are listed as following:

1. Checking result of left subtree and right subtree are both not null. That means one node exists in the left subtree, and the other one exists in the right subtree. Then current node is the LCA of the 2 given nodes.

2. One of the checking result from left subtree and right subtree is not null. That means 2 possibilities: 1) this result is the LCA of the 2 given nodes, return this result. 2) this result is the ancestor of one of the 2 given nodes, in this case we need to further check the current node's value and the value of the 2 given nodes. If one of the value is equal to current node's value, then current node is the LCA, return current node.

3. Both checking results are null. Then we also need to check if current node's value is equal to the value of the 2 given nodes. If so, return current node. Otherwise, return null.

Time complexity: `O(n)` where n is the total number of nodes in the tree.

Space complexity: `O(logn)` for recursion stack because this is the maximum depth we can get. 

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    /**
     * Assume root is not null.
     */
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        TreeNode left = null;
        TreeNode right = null;
        if (root.left != null) {
            left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        }
        if (root.right != null) {
            right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        }
        
        if (left != null && right != null) {
            return root;
        } else if (root.val == p.val || root.val == q.val) {
            return root;
        } else if (left == null && right == null) {
            return null;
        } else {
            return left != null ? left : right;
        }
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Using the fact that this is a BST

If both `p` and `q` are on the same subtree of root, then we simply need to check that subtree. And this condition can be indicated by `(root.val - p.val) * (root.val - q.val) > 0`. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` worst case where n is the number of TreeNodes since in the worst case we have to check all nodes.

Space complexity: `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        while ((root.val - p.val) * (root.val - q.val) > 0) { // both p and q are on the same subtree of root
            root = root.val > p.val ? root.left : root.right;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```
