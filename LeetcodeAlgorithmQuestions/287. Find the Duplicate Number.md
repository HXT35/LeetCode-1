# Solution1: Sort the array

Straight forward solution. Sort the array to make all the same number aggregated together. Then scan the array to get the duplicate number. 

Time complexity: `O(nlogn)`

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                return nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: HashSet

Straight forward solution, using a HashSet to keep the numbers we have encountered. Hence as soon as we find a new number that already exists in the HashSet, it is the duplicate one. 

Time complexity: `O(n)`

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (set.contains(i)) {
                return i;
            }
            set.add(i);
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

# Solution3: Binary Search for range of numbers

However, the above 2 methods violates the question requirement. Since there is only 1 duplicate number in the array, we know that this ensures that for number range from `[i, j]`, there should be only `j - i + 1` numbers within this range exist in the array. This gives us the ability to search the range of numbers in a binary search style. And the judge condition should be how many numbers in the array are located in this current range. The algorithm can be described as following:

1. Start with the range `[start, end]`. Initialize with `start = 1, end = n`.  
2. Find the middle point `mid = start + (end - start) / 2` of the range.  
3. Count the number of numbers in `nums[]` array located witn in the current range `[start, mid]`.   
4. If `count <= (mid - start + 1)`, meaning that each number from `start` to `mid` at most shows up once in the array, then the duplicate number is in `[mid + 1, end]`. Go to step 2.  
5. Otherwise, the duplicate number is in `[start, mid]`. Go to step 2.   

Time complexity: `O(nlogn)` since each time we through away half of the range and each iteration takes `O(n)` time to check `nums[]` array for `count`. 

Space complexity: `O(1)`  

```Java
class Solution {
    /**
     * O(nlogn) time, O(1) space solution using binary search with range. 
     */
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int start = 1;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            int count = getCount(nums, start, mid);
            if (count <= (mid - start + 1)) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
    
    private int getCount(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i >= start && i <= end) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
