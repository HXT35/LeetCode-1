# Solution1: Ad-hoc constructing and matching

Were String `B` be a substring of a String constructed by repeated `A`, then the start character of `B` need to at least exist in somewhere in `A`, ranging from `A.charAt(0)` to `A.charAt(A.length() - 1)`.  

Considering `S = A + A + A + ... + A`. And suppose `B` starts with some character from `S[0]` to `S[A.length() - 1]`. In order for `S` to containing `B`, and given A's length, A need to repeat itself for `q` times, where `q` satisfies `A.length() * q >= B.length()`. However, if the start character of `B` is not `A.length(0)`, then the end of `B` might exceeds the end of `S`, so if `B` is not a substring of `A*q`, we need to add an extra `A` after it and check again. If `B` is still not a substring of it, then we know the answer is `-1`. Otherwise, the answer is `q + 1`.  

Hence we know that we only need to check 2 conditions, given `q`, one is that `A` is repeated for `q` times. The other is that `A` is repeated for `q + 1` times.  

Suppose `M = A.length()` and `N = B.length()`. 

Time complexity: `O(N/M + N*(M+N)) = O(N*(M+N)`

Space complexity: `O(M+N)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int repeatedStringMatch(String A, String B) {
        if (A == null || B == null) return -1;
        int ret = 1;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(A);
        for (; sb.length() < B.length(); ret++) sb.append(A);
        if (sb.indexOf(B) >= 0) return ret;
        if (sb.append(A).indexOf(B) >= 0) return ret + 1;
        return -1;
    }
}
```
