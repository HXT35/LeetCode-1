# Solution1: Recursion

Considering the tree structure, it is very suitable for a recursion solution. Since it is a BST, we know that any node on the left branch is less than or equal to `root.val`, and any node on the right branch is greater than or equal to `root.val`. Thus we can perform the trim process based on comparing `root.val` with `L` and `R`.   

Following conditions should be checked.  

1. `L > R` or `root == null`, we know that we finished trimming the current branch and there should be no more nodes remaining in current branch. Hence we return `null`.   
2. `root.val < L`, we know that all the nodes that satisfies the current requirement lies in the left branch of `root`.   
3. `root.val > R`, we know that all the nodes that satisfies the current requirement lies in the right branch of `root`.   
4. If `L < root.val < R`, we know that nodes that satisfies the current requirment lies in both `left` and `right` branch of `root`.   

Hence we have the following implementation.   

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.  

Space Complexity: `O(1)` if not considering the recursion stack. The recursion stack takes `O(logn)` space.  

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode trimBST(TreeNode root, int L, int R) {
        if (root == null) return root;
        if (L > R) return null;
        if (root.val > R) return trimBST(root.left, L, R);
        if (root.val < L) return trimBST(root.right, L, R);
        root.left = trimBST(root.left, L, root.val);
        root.right = trimBST(root.right, root.val, R);
        return root; 
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Iteration

The basic idea is still the same with the recursion solution.   

So we first find a valid node as the root based on the `2` and `3` statements above. That is, if `root.val > R`, valid root is in the left subtree, and if `root.val < L`, valid root is in the right subtree.  

Once We found a valid root that satisfies `L ≤ root.val ≤ R`, we know that the range `[L, R]` lies from left subtree of root, goes through root, to right subtree of root. Thus we should check left subtree and right subtree of current root, respectively, to remove the invalid nodes whose value lies outside `[L, R]`. 

The removing process should based on the following criteria:  

1. For left subtree: If the value of left child of current root is less than `L`, then only keep the right subtree of left child.    
2. For right subtree: If the value of right child of current root is less than `R`, then only keep the left subtree of right child.  
3. Do the above 2 steps continuously until the left/right child is `null`, respectively.  

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree since we need to check every node in the worst case.  

Space complexity: `O(1)`.  

```
class Solution {
    public TreeNode trimBST(TreeNode root, int L, int R) {
        if (root == null) return root;
        // find a valid root
        while (root.val > R || root.val < L) {
            if (root.val > R) {
                root = root.left;
            } else { // dummy.val < L
                root = root.right;
            }
        }
        
        // find valid nodes in left subtree
        TreeNode dummy = root;
        while (dummy != null) {
            while (dummy.left != null && dummy.left.val < L) {
                // if the left child is less than L, remove the whole left subtree and keep the right subtree of left child
                dummy.left = dummy.left.right;
            }
            dummy = dummy.left;
        }
        
        // find valid nodes in right subtree
        dummy = root;
        while (dummy != null) {
            while (dummy.right != null && dummy.right.val > R) {
                // if the right child is greater than R, remove the whole right subtree and keep the left subtree of right child
                dummy.right = dummy.right.left;
            }
            dummy = dummy.right;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```
