# Solution1: Sliding window

This question is a typical question that can be solved by using our [substring template](https://github.com/YaokaiYang-assaultmaster/LeetCode/blob/master/GeneralizedMethod/%5BImportant%5DA%20template%20that%20can%20solve%20most%20%22substring%22%20problems.md). That is, we keep the status of the substring into a HashMap, based on the specification of the question. This question requires us to find the longest substring in which contains at most `k` duplicate characters. Thus we keep a HashMap to store the characters and their number we have encountered in the current substring. 

The substring is represented by two pointers labelled as `start` and `end`. Once we have less than or equal to `k` characters in our sliding window, we update the max length recorded is necessary and move the `end` pointer forward. Once we have more than `k` characters in our sliding window, we move the `start` pointer forward until we remove one character out from our HashMap (indicated by the count of the character turns into zero).    

Note that the HashMap in this solution can be substituted using a `nums[256]` as well. In this case we need to keep an extra counter for the number of characters rather than calling the `HashMap.size()` function.  

Time complexity: `O(n)` time where `n` is the number of characters in the input string.   

Space complexity: `O(n)` space in the worst case when `k` is greater than `s.length()` and s contains only different characters in it.   

```Java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
        if (s == null || s.isEmpty() || k == 0) return 0;
        
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        char[] chs = s.toCharArray();
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        while (end < chs.length) {
            map.put(chs[end], map.getOrDefault(chs[end], 0) + 1);
            // if we now have a substring contains `k+1` distinct characters
                while (map.size() > k) {
                    int count = map.get(chs[start]) - 1;
                    map.put(chs[start], count);
                    if (count == 0) map.remove(chs[start]);
                    start++;
                }
            ret = Math.max(ret, end - start + 1);
            end++;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
