# Solution1: Three step simulation

This question is basically a iterative graph traversal problem. If we only consider one turn of it, it basically contains 3 steps:   
1. Using DFS to find all contaminated regions, aka connected components, in the graph. In addition, keep track of the cells that will be infected at next step, as well as the perimeters, aka walls, we need to build were we going to build walls around it.  
2. Find out the most hazardous contaminated region, i.e. the region that is going to infect the highest number of innocent cells in next round, and build walls to isolate it. The number of walls is equal to the perimeter of the region. In this algorithm, we change the value of the cells in this isolated contaminated region to `-1`, indicating that it is neutralized.   
3. For all the remaining contaminated regions, spread their infection around to adjacent cells in 4 directions.  

Since we cannot know how many rounds it will take to finish the whole problem, we need to have a criteria to tell us that the iteration 
comes to an end. And we can do this via checking how many contaminated regions we still have after each depth-first-search. If the number of newly found region is `0`, we know that we should stop the iteration as there is nothing to update anymore.
