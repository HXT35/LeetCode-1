# Solution1: Loop through every bits

```
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int bits = 0;
        int mask = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((n & mask) != 0) {
                bits++;
            }
            mask = mask << 1;
        }
        
        return bits;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Flip the least significant bit each time until n becomes 0

There is an interesting bit manimulation trick: for any number n, doing a bitwise AND between n ang n-1 will flip the least significant bit in the number to 0. See the following example:

`n = 000100, n-1 = 000011`, then `n & (n - 1) = 000000`, in which the least significant bit is being flipped.

```
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int bits = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            bits++;
            n &= (n - 1);
        }
        
        return bits;
    }
}
```
