> Note that there is a previous version of this question that returns a String of tasks being scheduled. This solution can be found [here](https://github.com/YaokaiYang-assaultmaster/LeetCode/blob/master/OtherAlgorithmQuestions/Task%20Scheduling.md).

The idea is the same. However, since we do not care about the actual sequence of the tasksï¼Œ we don't need keep the `{task:count}` pairs. 
Thus we only keep the occurance of each task in a map and sort the map afterwards. 

Each round we take the task (no matter which one it is) with highest occurance out and execute it. Then the second highest one, etc. Until we hit the task cool-down time. At this point, the most efficient way is to start another round of execution based on current occurance. Thus we sort the map and repeat the whole process. _Note, that if there is not enough task in the map to fill out every interval during cool-down time, we need to wait for the cooling._ This process will continue until there is no task left (highest occurance equal to 0). 

Time complexity would be `O(t)` where `t` is the time needed to finish all tasks. Note that the sorting process here is constant time since the map is constant size. `O(1)` space since the map is constant size.

Java implementation is showed as following:

```
class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] map = new int[26];
        for (char task : tasks) {
            map[task - 'A']++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(map);
        int time = 0;
        while (map[25] > 0) {
            int i = 0;
            while (i <= n) {
                if (map[25] == 0) {
                    break;
                }
                if (i < 26 && map[25 - i] > 0) {
                    map[25 - i]--;
                }
                time++;
                i++;
            }
            Arrays.sort(map);
        }
        
        return time;
    }
}
```
